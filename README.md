# Avengers Bootstrapped

  This is a simple site that I bootstrapped to practice and demonstrate my
  knowledge of the basics.  

## Technology

  I created the site in Rails to make the code DRYer.  My focus was
  using Bootstrap and putting the frameworks basics into this site.  I used
  Bootstraps: accordion, modal, carousel, grid system, dropdown menu, forms and
  navbar.  I used Bootstraps basics styles with a little of my own, keeping it simple.
  I did include a carousel using slippry.js, which is a plugin I found that has a great
  transition mode called 'Ken Burns'; I couldn't resist!  It is fully responsive.

## How to use

  Please fork, clone down and use this as a template to build off what I have started. Please submit back any cool alterations, have fun!
