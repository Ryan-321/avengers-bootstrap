# Avengers Bootstrapped

  This is a simple site that I bootstrapped to practice and demonstrate my knowledge of the basics. I kept the styles limited to what Bootstrap offers.   

## Technology

  I created the site in Rails to make the code DRYer.  My focus was
  using Bootstrap and putting the frameworks basics into this site.  I used
  Bootstraps: accordion, modal, carousel, grid system, dropdown menu, forms and
  navbar. I hosted the pictures on AWS and included a carousel using slippry.js, which is a plugin  with a great transition called 'Ken Burns'; I couldn't resist, its awesome!  It is fully responsive.

## How to use

  Please fork, clone down and use this as a template to build off what I have started. Please submit back any cool alterations, have fun!
