# Avengers Bootstrapped

  This is a simple site that I bootstrapped to practice and demonstrate my
  knowledge of the basics.  

## Technology

    I created the site in Rails to make the code a little DRYer.  My focus was
    using Bootstrap and putting the frameworks basics into this site.  I used
    Bootstraps: accordion, modal, carousel, grid system, dropdown menu, forms and
    navbar.  

## How to use

    Please fork, clone down and use this as a template to build off what I have
    started.  Have fun!
